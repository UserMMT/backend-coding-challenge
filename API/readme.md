# Backend
    A good choice would be to build the REST API in laravel, but with my little knowledge of laravel it would be a bad choice.
    We can also simply build the rest API endpoint using htaccess to redirect all requests from the API folder to index.php this is not the cleanest way but it will give us the same result
